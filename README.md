## About sequence code
```
* 0 101001001100101101111111111 1111 1111 001111111111
* 0 <-------    A    ---------> < B> < C> <---- D --->
```
* All total 48 bits
* 1st bit 0
* A is the interstamp difference length 27
* B is the application code Length 4, value range 0-15. 16 services can be configured
* C is the machine code Length 4, value range 0-15. 16 machines can be configured
* D is a sequential code Length 12, range 0-4095. generates 4095 sequential codes per second
